# House_Price_Pred_web_app
House_price_prediction
We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. T
echnology and tools wise this project covers,

Python 
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building Jupyter notebook, 
visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server 
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
